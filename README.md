## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The r^2 value is at .71 which means that roughly 71% of mpg predictions will be correct when using this linear model. This means that the linear model will predict the mpg of MechaCar protoypes effectviely. With a p-value of 5.35e-11 I can say that there is sufficient evidence thst the slope of the linear model is not 0. The variables of vehicle_length and ground_clearance have significant impact on the predicted mpg. Since the intercept is statistically significant, that means that there are other variables that contribute to the variation in the mpg that have not been included in this model.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

When the lots are averaged together the variance does pass the 100 PSI requirement at 62.29. When the lots are seperated to have their own averages, lots 1 & 2 pass with .979 and 7.469, respectivley. Lot 3 does not pass the requirement becuase the variance for that is 170.286.
